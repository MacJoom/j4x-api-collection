# j4x-api-collection
An attempt to help the Joomla! 4 early adopters mainly focused for developers. It's an unofficial Postman collection of official Joomla 4 beta API 

# Update the urls
Once you have imported the collection into Postman you will need to change the urls from `https://www.example.com` to your own domain. The easiest way to do this on mass is to use the Search and Replace functionality in Postman. See https://blog.getpostman.com/2018/11/13/find-and-replace-text-code-and-variables-in-postman/
